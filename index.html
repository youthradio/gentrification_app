                <h2>Gentrification in West Oakland</h2>

                <p>We tend to talk about gentrification as one story: newcomers
                displace long-time residents, erasing history and disrupting
                culture in the process. But living through dramatic
                neighborhood change always brings up many stories. Those
                stories--from West Oakland's people and places--are what this
                interactive is all about.</p>

                <p>There's a lot to disagree about, when it comes to
                gentrification. But one thing seems beyond debate. If you're
                new to a place, it's good to know a thing or two about its
                history. So West Oakland's proud past is one of the most
                important stories you'll learn about in West Side
                Stories.</p><img class="scroll" src="images/mouse_grey.png">

                "images/bart.png">

                <p>Turf dancing is a form of American street dance that is said
                to have originated in Oakland, California. According to locals,
                credit for the term goes to dancer Jeriel Bey, who created it
                as an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor. Prior names for
                the dance form, like "having fun with it" or "hitting it"
                didn't seem as marketable. Dance elements include popping,
                locking, and miming. If you ride through the West Oakland BART
                station, you just might encounter a Turf dancer, making the
                most of the crowded train as a moving stage.</p>

                "images/hotel.png">

                <p>Built in the 1920s, the California Hotel was once a place
                that welcomed African American artists and musicians when they
                were discriminated against elsewhere. Then, somewhere around
                the 1970s--you know what was going on around that time--the
                neighborhood started to deteriorate. The hotel ran into
                financial trouble and eventually closed. Fast forward to 2011:
                the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation and other
                supporters pulled together funds for a major renovation. Now,
                the California Hotel provides 137 units of low-income housing
                and even has a rooftop garden.</p>

                <p>Built in 1912 and no longer in active use, the 16th Street station was once among the largest transportation centers in Oakland. It housed the West Coast branch of the very first African American Labor Union in America and was the last stop for many African Americans leaving the South. The station is now owned by an affordable housing non-profit with ambitious plans for restoration. In the meantime, it’s occasionally used for events like haunted houses and film shoots.</p>

                activities, and the park was a distribution site for free food
                and sickle-cell anemia testing. With its landmark Victorian
                house, DeFremery is now a gathering place for West Oakland
                residents and families, who get together there for community

                <p>U.S. Olympic sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold
                and bronze medalists in the 200 meter, stood at the medal

                heads and held a black-gloved hand raised as the American
                National Anthem played during the victory ceremony. This was a
                mural commemorating this historic Olympic event, with images of
                the athletes and the phrase, "It only takes a pair of gloves."
